# Module 2 Challenge
## Refactoring Performance Analysis 
Using the stock analysis data from the classwork, we compare the speed at which the computer completes the equivilent functions. The original function should run slower since the program crawls throught the entire set of data twelve times. The refactored equivilent will only run through the data one time, which should mean that the refactored function will be completed quicker.
